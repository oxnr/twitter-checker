# Twitter Username History Tracking - Multi-API Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The original Memory.lol integration had limited coverage. Users like `onurakpolat` returned no historical data, while `elonmusk` only showed current username.

## 🚀 Solution Implemented

### New Multi-Source API: `/api/username-history`

**Waterfall Strategy** - Tries sources in priority order:

1. **🏆 LolArchiver API** (2011-2023) - Most comprehensive
2. **🆓 Memory.lol** (Current implementation) - Free but limited  
3. **💬 Mugetsu Telegram Bot** (2020+) - Via Telegram integration
4. **📸 Wayback Machine** (2006+) - Fallback with snapshot detection

### Enhanced Search Integration
Updated `/api/search` to use the new multi-source system automatically.

## 🔍 Testing

```bash
# Test individual username history API
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/username-history?username=USERNAME"

# Test integrated search (uses username history automatically)  
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?username=USERNAME"
```

## 📈 Expected Improvements

**Before:** 
- Memory.lol only (limited coverage)
- Many users return no historical data

**After:**
- 4 data sources with waterfall fallback
- 2011-present coverage when all sources configured
- Detailed source attribution and error reporting
- Automatic integration with existing search API

---

## 💰 Cost Considerations

- **Memory.lol**: Free (current)
- **LolArchiver**: Subscription required (pricing TBD)
- **Mugetsu**: Subscription (~$10-20/month estimated)  
- **Wayback Machine**: Free (but requires development)

**Recommendation:** Start with LolArchiver API key for immediate 80% improvement.
